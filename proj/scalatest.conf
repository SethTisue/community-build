// We don't attempt to compile or run the tests at all.  (We used to;
// see version control history.  On 3.0 we compiled and ran them;
// on 3.1 we just compiled them.)

// The tests involve a lot of code generation and even figuring out
// how to run them on 3.2 seems complicated.  Perhaps I'll get some
// guidance at https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/1851
// and/or https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/1852 on how
// this can be easily done.

// In the meantime, the fact that ScalaTest is used in so many downstream
// projects should mean that it's getting a good workout.
