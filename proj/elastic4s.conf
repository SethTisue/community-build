// dependency of scaladex.  pinned at exact version scaladex expects
// (as of October 2020).  we cannot move to master because
// master drops elastic4s-embedded, which scaladex still uses
// (as of December 2020).  see sksamuel/elastic4s#1656

// it's a shame to stuck with sbt 0.13 and ScalaTest 3.0 as a result.
// if either of those gets to be problematic, one possibility would be
// to just have Scaladex uses binaries from Maven Central.  then we'd
// free to upgrade this repo (or to drop it entirely)
