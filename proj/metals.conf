// https://github.com/scalacommunitybuild/metals.git#community-build-2.13  # was scalameta, main

// temporarily forked (November 2022) to adjust an expected
// test output -- we should unfork once Scala 2.13.11 is out

// though if we want to unfork, we'll have trouble because at present
// (19 Feb 2023) metals is on scalameta 4.7.1, whereas here in the
// community build we only have 4.6.0, because that's what scalafmt
// expects. I left a comment on https://github.com/scalameta/scalafmt/issues/3466
// expressing interest in seeing Scalafmt upgrade.

// note that there are always test failures when we run on a PR validation
// snapshot. (we could probably fix it by adding a resolver in the repo?)

  // At present, the net here is cast wider than that, but it's advice to keep
