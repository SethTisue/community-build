// March 2021, frozen at a known-green commit.  `lib/Test/compile` fails after
// https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/commit/3705555f3d81269574a2e3de39a9317aa1d8e1da
// and I am totally mystified why. failed to reproduce the problem outside of dbuild.
// I wanted to use `dbuild checkout` to troubleshoot, that hardly ever fails, but
// in this case dbuild is choking, I don't know why. it's annoying but it's turning
// into a timesink, so, shrug, I guess
