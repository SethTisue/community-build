// frozen (January 2020) at a December 2019 commit before a dependency
// on cats-effect-testing was added.  adding cats-effect-testing was blocked
// by https://github.com/djspiewak/sbt-spiewak/issues/5 . freezing is fine,
// we don't need to deal with this right now

// this is a big build with a ton of subprojects.  we needn't be shy
// about disabling fragile ones, ones with obscure dependencies we
// don't have, etc.
