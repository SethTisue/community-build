// https://github.com/scalacommunitybuild/akka-http.git#community-build-2.13  # was akka, master

// frozen (February 2020) at a February 2020 commit (8d8aaa8f9a502b5d0f3e6de83e02b4bcdd0bf435)
// just before UseHttp2 was removed from the API (playframework, downstream, still uses it)

// forked (July 2020) for ScalaTest 3.2 compatibility -- had to cherry-pick a commit (50a899f7753)
// with the needed changes, it postdated the freeze point
