// frozen (September 2019) at an August 2019 commit sometime before a silencer
// upgrade; we have silencer frozen waiting on ScalaTest 3.1

// 2.13: frozen instead at an October 2019 commit before some monix-related breakage
// started. why not the same as the 2.12 commit? well, I just took the last green
// here on 2.13, I didn't really assess the situation properly, I figure we can sort
// the discrepancy out after the ScalaTest 3.1 move
