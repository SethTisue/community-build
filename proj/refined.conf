  // I don't see a project that aggregates just the JVM subprojects, so we name them one by one.
  // scodecJVM isn't included because the dependency wasn't found, maybe a version mismatch?
  // it's okay, we don't need to have absolutely every subproject
  // pureconfigJVM, same, though the problem didn't start until November 2018.  maybe
  // unfreezing pureconfig (or updating our fork) would fix it, but I'd rather not mess
  // it with right now.
